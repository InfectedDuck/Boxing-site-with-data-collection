# Boxing Club Website

Welcome to the Boxing Club GitHub repository! This repository contains the source code for a boxing club website designed to provide information about the boxing club, its classes, schedule, and contact details, as well as allowing users to register for classes online.

## Introduction

The Boxing Club website is built using HTML, CSS, and PHP, with a MySQL database for storing user data. It provides essential information about the club, including its mission, classes offered, schedule, and contact information. Users can also register for classes through the website, and the system includes basic form validation, password hashing, and error handling to ensure security and usability.

## Features

- **About Us**: Learn about the mission and values of the Boxing Club.
- **Classes**: Discover the different classes offered by the club, suitable for beginners to advanced boxers.
- **Schedule**: View the class schedule to plan your training sessions.
- **Contact Us**: Find contact details to get in touch with the club.
- **User Registration**: Register for classes online with secure data handling.
- **Dynamic Background**: The website features a changing background design for an engaging user experience.

## Setup

To set up the Boxing Club website locally, follow these steps:

1. **Web Server Environment**:
   - Ensure you have a web server environment set up (e.g., Apache, Nginx) with PHP support. You can use XAMPP or a similar tool for an easy setup.

2. **Copy Files**:
   - Copy the contents of the repository to your web server's root directory. For XAMPP, this means placing all files into a folder within `htdocs`.

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Create a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin or another MySQL client. Import the provided SQL schema to set up the necessary tables.

4. **Configure Database Connection**:
   - Update the database connection details in the PHP files (`cnt.php`, `registration.php`) to match your database configuration. Ensure the database name, username, and password are correctly set.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can access the Boxing Club website by navigating to its URL in your web browser. From there, you can:

- Explore the various sections of the website to learn about the club and its offerings.
- Register for classes through the online registration form.
- View the class schedule and plan your training sessions.
- Contact the club using the provided contact details.

## Design and Functionality

### Background Design

- **Dynamic Background**: The website features a changing background design to keep the user experience engaging. The background color or image transitions smoothly, enhancing the visual appeal of the site.

### SQL Usage

- **Database Schema**: The website uses a MySQL database to store user information and class registrations. The schema includes tables for users, classes, and schedules.
- **phpMyAdmin**: Use phpMyAdmin to manage your MySQL database. It provides an easy-to-use interface for viewing and manipulating the data stored in your tables.

### PHP Implementation

- **Form Handling**: PHP is used to handle form submissions, including user registration. The registration form includes basic validation to ensure that all required fields are completed and passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database.
- **Database Interaction**: PHP scripts interact with the MySQL database to perform operations such as user registration and data retrieval. Secure database queries and prepared statements are used to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **Error Handling**: The website includes basic error handling to manage issues such as invalid form submissions or database connection problems. Users receive informative error messages to guide them through resolving any issues.
